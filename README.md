Hi, I'm Georgia 👋

Computer science graduate from Reykjavik University with a background in backend development and data processing. I enjoy building tools that solve real problems.

Currently looking for my first junior developer role in Iceland.

Things I work with: Python, Flask, JavaScript, React Native, OpenCV, Git

Some things I've built:

```
🌋 lavaStream — near real-time PIV analysis of drone-captured lava flow footage

📚 Kindle Library Exporter — extracts and enriches Kindle library data via the Open Library API
```
